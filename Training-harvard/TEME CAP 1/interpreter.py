# In a file called interpreter.py, implement a program that prompts the user for an arithmetic expression
# and then calculates and outputs the result as a floating-point value formatted to one decimal place.
# Assume that the userâ€™s input will be formatted as x y z, with one space between x and y and one space
# between y and z, wherein:
#
# x is an integer
# y is +, -, *, or /
# z is an integer
# For instance, if the user inputs 1 + 1, your program should output 2.0. Assume that, if y is /,
# then z will not be 0.
#
# Note that, just as python itself is an interpreter for Python, so will your interpreter.py be an
# interpreter for math!
